learn [hugging face](https://huggingface.co/) transformers (transfer learning)

based on [Hugging Face Transformers Package &#8211; What Is It and How To Use It - KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/02/hugging-face-transformer-basics.html)


Transformers is an opinionated library built for:

* NLP researchers and educators seeking to use/study/extend large-scale transformers models
* hands-on practitioners who want to fine-tune those models and/or serve them in production
* engineers who just want to download a pretrained model and use it to solve a given NLP task.

## Demo

```sh
pipenv install
pipenv install transformers
pipenv install tensorflow

# test install
python -c "from transformers import pipeline; print(pipeline('sentiment-analysis')('we love you'))"

# note first run will download the [pipeline] model (potentially time consuming) on first run
pipenv run python main.py
```
